*(*basic info's*)*

## Test Cases

### Definition
*A test case is a detailed set of instructions or steps that a tester follows to verify a specific aspect of software functionality.*

### Purpose     
*Test cases help ensure that the software behaves as expected under various conditions.*



## why test case's matter:

Test cases are essential for ensuring the quality of a software application. Below are some points highlighting their significance:

- **Identification of Defects and Bugs:** Test cases help in identifying defects and bugs in the software application.

- **Verification of Requirements:** Test cases assist in verifying whether the software application meets its functional and non-functional requirements.

- **Validation of Accuracy and Completeness:** Test cases help in validating the accuracy and completeness of the software application.

- **Establishment of Quality Standards:** Test cases help establish quality standards for the software application.

- **Progress Tracking:** Test cases assist in tracking the progress of software testing activities.

- **Guide for Developers:** Test cases act as a guide for developers to fix defects and errors.

- **Cost Reduction:** Test cases help reduce software development costs by detecting defects early in the development lifecycle.













### Components
1. **Preconditions:** Conditions that must be met before executing the test case.
2. **Test Steps:** The sequence of actions to perform (e.g., input data, interactions with the software).
3. **Expected Results:** The anticipated outcome or behavior.

### Example
**Test Case:** Verify login functionality  
**Preconditions:** User is on the login page.  
**Test Steps:**  
1. Enter valid username and password.  
2. Click the “Login” button.  
**Expected Result:** User successfully logs in.

### Use Cases
*Describe here the specific use cases related to the test cases, if applicable.*

### Application Details
*Provide information about the application under test, such as its purpose, features, and technology stack.*

### Provider
*Specify the provider or organization responsible for providing the test cases and their types.*

## Test Suites

### Definition
*A test suite is a collection of related test cases grouped together for efficient execution.*

### Purpose
- Organize test cases logically.
- Execute multiple test cases as a single unit.
- Simplify reporting and tracking.

### Components
1. **Grouping:** Test cases are grouped based on common functionality, features, or scenarios.
2. **Execution Order:** Define the order in which test cases should run.
3. **Configuration:** Specify any setup or teardown steps needed.

### Example
**Test Suite:** “User Authentication”  
**Included Test Cases:**
- "Login with valid credentials"
- "Login with invalid credentials"
- "Forgot password functionality"

### Use Cases
*Describe here the specific use cases related to the test suite, if applicable.*

### Application Details
*Provide information about the application under test, such as its purpose, features, and technology stack.*

### Provider
*Specify the provider or organization responsible for providing the test suites and their types.*
